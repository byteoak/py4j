"""JVM lifecycle helpers for the perf framework.

Spawns a fresh ``py4j.examples.ExampleApplication`` per scenario so no state
bleeds between measurements. Uses ``subprocess.Popen`` (rather than the
``multiprocessing.Process`` wrapper used by the existing test suite) because
we need direct control over JVM flags and teardown semantics.

The classpath resolution and readiness-probe logic is adapted from
``py4j/tests/java_gateway_test.py`` (PY4J_JAVA_PATHS, check_connection,
safe_shutdown). Keeping our own copy avoids importing from the test module.

    """Spawn a JVM, build a gateway, yield it, then tear both down.

    Readiness model: poll connect ``readiness_retries`` times waiting
    ``readiness_poll_s`` between attempts. Total wait ceiling =
    ``startup_sleep + readiness_retries * readiness_poll_s`` (default
    15 s — enough headroom for any reasonable CI runner while keeping
    the typical fast-host wait under ~100 ms).

    Tight polling matters for XD (full cold start) on CodSpeed: the
    previous default (0.25 s sleep + 1 retry × 2 s) made each XD
    iteration cost ~2.7 s, leaving CodSpeed only ~1 sample per benchmark
    budget — too few for variance / regression detection. With 50 ms
    polling each XD round now finishes in ~600 ms, enough for 4-5
    samples per budget. (issue #557)

    Backwards compatibility: callers that previously relied on the
    0.25 s startup_sleep can pass ``startup_sleep=0.25`` to restore
    the old behavior. The JVM's listen socket uses ``SO_REUSEADDR``,
    so the original "let the OS reuse the listen port" rationale for
    the unconditional sleep no longer applies — bind() succeeds
    immediately even over TIME_WAIT.

    :param enable_callbacks: if True, start a CallbackServer alongside
        the gateway so Java can invoke Python proxies (needed for X4).
